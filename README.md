# TEMDAO
## Introduction
* The global pandemic of COVID-19 is being brought under control, but the uncertainty of the world is still increasing from the conflicts between nations and extreme weather. 
* Under such circumstances, the protectoin and restoration mandates of World Heritage, as set forth by UNESCO, has become very difficult to pay for due to the sharp decline in tourism income affected by the harsh restrictictions on the movement of people and goods caused by COVID-19.
* The TemDAO Project will redefine the approach towards World Heritage and cultural assets, transforming it into a sustainable approach to tackle these challenges that have not been apparent until today.
